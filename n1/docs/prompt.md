# JOBBO - TECHNICAL CHALLENGE GAME

**PHASE 1 :** Open field navigation
**PHASE 2 :** Navigate through maze walls

## OBJECTIVE:
Navigate your character to collect apples. Complete all levels with the fewest total moves and the fastest time to achieve the highest score.

## CONTROLS:
• Arrow keys or WASD to move
• Each move counts toward your score
• Lower total moves = better ranking
• Faster time to completion = better ranking

## GAME MECHANICS:
• Apple and player positions are deterministic (not random)
• Board size increases over time
• Walls appear in Phase 2 but solutions are guaranteed
• You have a maximum of 1 hour to complete this, it is very much possible to finish this much faster than that (we encourage you to set the fastest record!)

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
You are encouraged to use ANY tools at your disposal - AI assistants, code analysis tools, or any other resources you can think of. We encourage you to cheat and find clever ways to complete this as fast as possible. You will not make it if you actually play the game normally. This is a technical challenge not a "monkey" challenge ;)

## BONUS:
Whoever sets the record time and score will be rewarded $150 irrespective of the hiring process.

***Good luck!***
