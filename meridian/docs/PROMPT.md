We're going to create a web app that satisfies the requirements in the submitted pdf.


The application should take up the full page. The app should be styled like linear.app I've provide a figma file that should help with that.

2 panels
The Page selection menu (an aside element)
The Main Panel (an main element) (main content and submission drawer)

# The Page Selection
Allows users to see what pages they can navigate too, which page is currently selected, and a count of assets on each page.

As the page grows in length the page should remain fixed.

For each list item the icon and title, icon is to the right of title, will be aligned to the left the and a group of or singular asset count will be aligned to the left. Each item should be vertically centered. The item that navigates to the current page should have a darker highlight than that of unselected active items in the hover state. Selected and disabled items have no hover state. Disabled Items have lighter text than active and selected items.

The list will have 3 items a Insights, Actions, & Trash. Insight will use an inbox icon it's count will be all the unactioned insights. Actions will use an checked box icon it's count will be all the insights turned into actions. Trash will use an trash icon it's count will be all the dismissed insights. Insight will be the default page, Action and Trash will be disabled but have working counts.

# The Main Section
Composed of 2 parts

Main List and Submission Drawer 

The Submission Drawer is meant to allow for bulk submissions of Edits, Dismisses, and Snoozes. It also allows user to undo their submissions in bulk or singularly.
The Submission Drawer only comes out when there are action(s) to be submit.
For the time being do not put only put 
There will be buckets for each type of action preformed and. A Bucket is only visible if there is at least 1 of that action to be submitted. Buckets allow for the submission and undoing of single actions or the whole bucket. The Submission Drawer allows for a submission of all the actions at the same time.

The Main List 

The unselected list item should expose title, priority, category and data. Titles should be the primary and the other data should be secondary to it. The data will be aligned to the left. The available actions will be aligned to the right. The Actions are to snooze, dismiss, and make action.

The list should be inline with prior prompts but restyle to look like linear.
